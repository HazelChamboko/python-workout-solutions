# 🐍 Python Workout: My Book of Answers

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the book **"Python Workout" by Reuven Lerner**. 

My goal is to transition from someone who just debugs code to a true **Pythonista** by practicing:
- Core Python logic and idiomatic "Pythonic" code.
- Version control using Git and GitHub.
- Clear documentation within Jupyter Notebooks.
